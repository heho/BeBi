# BeBi
a semantic web library written in stylus and coffeescript following material design principles. BeBi is short for Bennis Bibliothek which is German an translates to Bennis library, as I started working on it for a friend called Benni.

# usage
if you just wanted to use the precompiled source go ahead. Download it and include it in the head of your document using

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/BeBi.css">

you will have to look at the _index.html_ file to understand how it is working, as it is the current documentation for BeBi. If you would however like to change the variables found in _variables.styl_ you will have to install a stylus compiler first. Install nodejs and than use

    npm install -g stylus

to install stylus global. afterwards you use

    stylus BeBi.styl

to compile the source or

    stylus -c BeBi.styl
    
to compress it after compilation
